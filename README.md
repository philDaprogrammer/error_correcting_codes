## Overview 
   * The use of error correcting codes or ecc's for short are essential in ensuring the intergity of 
   data within the ditigal world. Whether storing, sending, or retrieving data. Ecc's play a vital role 
   in reliable communication and storage. This code repository contains python code that simulates storing data 
   on a hard disk using Reed solomon codes. This includes error correction if the "data" is corrupted. A paper     and video will be linked explaining the mathematical theory that makes this feasible.
